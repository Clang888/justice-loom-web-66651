  "faq": {
    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "subtitle": "Common questions about egg freezing and surrogacy in Hong Kong.",
    "backLink": "Back to Egg Freezing & Surrogacy",
    "moreQuestions": "Have more questions?",
    "moreQuestionsDesc": "Contact us for personalised guidance on your egg freezing or surrogacy journey.",
    "q1": "How long can I store my frozen eggs in HK?",
    "a1": "Under HK law, eggs can be stored for up to 10 years, with extensions possible under certain circumstances. You should check with your fertility clinic about specific storage policies and renewal requirements.",
    "q2": "Is surrogacy legal in HK?",
    "a2": "Surrogacy is highly regulated in Hong Kong by the Human Reproductive Technology Ordinance (HRTO) and the Parent and Child Ordinance (PCO). Many HK residents pursue surrogacy arrangements abroad.",
    "q3": "What is a Parental Order and when do I need one?",
    "a3": "A Parental Order transfers legal parenthood from the surrogate (and her partner, if applicable) to the intended parents. The requirements vary depending on where the surrogacy takes place and where you intend to raise the child.",
    "q4": "Can I use a surrogate abroad and bring the child back to HK?",
    "a4": "Yes, although the 'intended parents' on a child's birth certificate abroad are the 'legal parents' this does not have any legal weight in Hong Kong. The intended parents must apply for a Parental Order to be recognised as the legal parents of a surrogate baby born abroad.",
    "q5": "Do I need my partner's consent to use my frozen eggs?",
    "a5": "In Hong Kong, you must be married in order to use your frozen eggs. If embryos were created with a partner's sperm, both parties must consent to their use. Consent can be withdrawn at any time before the embryos are used.",
    "q6": "Can I pay a surrogate in HK?",
    "a6": "No.",
    "q7": "What is the difference between gestational and traditional surrogacy?",
    "a7": "In gestational surrogacy, the surrogate carries an embryo created from the intended parents' or donors' eggs and sperm, meaning she has no genetic connection to the child. In traditional surrogacy, the surrogate uses her own eggs, making her the biological mother. Gestational surrogacy is more common and legally straightforward in most jurisdictions.",
    "q8": "How much does surrogacy cost in the USA?",
    "a8": "Surrogacy costs in the USA typically range from USD $100,000 to $200,000 or more, depending on the state, agency fees, surrogate compensation, medical expenses, legal fees, and whether egg or sperm donation is required. It's important to budget for unexpected expenses as well.",
    "q9": "What happens if the surrogate wants to keep the baby?",
    "a9": "With proper legal contracts in place, this scenario is extremely rare. In surrogacy-friendly jurisdictions, pre-birth orders establish the intended parents as the legal parents before birth. A well-drafted surrogacy agreement protects all parties and makes such disputes legally untenable.",
    "q10": "Can single parents or same-sex couples use surrogacy?",
    "a10": "A couple must be legally married in order to be granted a Parental Order by the Hong Kong Court.",
    "q11": "What medical tests are required before egg freezing?",
    "a11": "Before egg freezing, you'll typically undergo blood tests to check hormone levels (AMH, FSH, estradiol), an ultrasound to assess ovarian reserve, and screening for infectious diseases. Your fertility specialist will also review your medical history and may recommend additional tests based on your individual circumstances.",
    "q12": "What is the success rate of using frozen eggs?",
    "a12": "Success rates depend on the age at which eggs were frozen. Eggs frozen before age 35 have higher success rates. Generally, about 80-90% of eggs survive the thawing process, and fertilisation rates are similar to fresh eggs. Your fertility clinic can provide personalised estimates based on your situation.",
    "q13": "How do I choose a surrogacy agency?",
    "a13": "Look for agencies with a strong track record, transparent pricing, thorough surrogate screening processes, and legal expertise. Ask about their matching process, support services, and what happens if complications arise. Seek references from previous intended parents and ensure they have experience with international clients if applicable.",
    "q14": "What legal documents are needed for international surrogacy?",
    "a14": "You'll typically need a surrogacy agreement, pre-birth or post-birth parentage order, the child's birth certificate, passport applications, and potentially immigration documents. Requirements vary by country. Working with lawyers in both the surrogacy country and your home country is essential to ensure all paperwork is properly handled.",
    "q15": "Can I freeze embryos instead of eggs?",
    "a15": "Yes, if you are a married heterosexual couple. Single women and same-sex couples cannot currently access treatment with donor sperm in Hong Kong, whether for IUI, IVF, or embryo freezing, under the existing regulatory framework."
